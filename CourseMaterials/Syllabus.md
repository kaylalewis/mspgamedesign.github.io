Students make use of traditional and digital media to reflect contemporary hybrid processes, such as sketchbooking, storyboarding, writing, HTML5, JavaScript, Stencyl, sound effect editors, and Wacom digital drawing tablets.

COURSE OBJECTIVES/OUTCOMES |
Through the camp, students will:

1.	Critically engage with games as a form of creative expression 
2.	Understand the logic of computers and build real world programming skills
3.	Experience the iterative process of creating a game by
a.	Articulating ideas through sketching, storyboarding and prototyping
b.	Implementing ideas in the visual programming platform Stencyl and on the web through Javascript and HTML5
c.	Testing and tuning based on feedback and playtesting
