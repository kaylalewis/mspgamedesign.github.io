# Detailed Syllabus #


## Week 1: Designing a series of games in Stencyl and HTML5 ##

Unless we go over to ATS for computers, the first day should be taught together.  After that, the class can be broken up into two sections - one taught by Mike and one by Kayla.  

Each day is 9a-5p with an hour lunch.  

### Session 1: What is a game ###

- **Discussion**: Introductions 
	- Who are we
	- Who are the students
	- Icebreakers
- **Discussion**: Overview and Schedule
	- Writing (on the whiteboard) what we will we cover in the camp
	- Writing (on the whiteboard) what we will we cover today
- **Discussion**: General classroom rules
	- Brainstorming the guidelines with the students
	- Laying out how the sharing of resources will be used
	- Write everything on the whiteboard
- **Discussion**: video games as a form of creative expression
	- What is the definition of a game?
	- How does a game differ from comics, movies, books, etc.?
	- What types of games exist?
	- What games do you like?
- **Discussion**: what does it take to make a game?
	- Story
	- Art
	- Programming
	- Feedback & Playtesting
- **Activity**: Critical play of **[insert game]**, understanding the creative side of a game
	- Everyone play game
	- Independently fill out a worksheet/paper with directed analysis
	- Class discussion analyzing the game
		- What did we like
		- What didn't we like
		- What was the message or intent of the game
		- Etc **[fill these in]** 
- **Activity**: Simulating a computer, understanding the nuts and bolts of the logic of a game
	- Exercise designed to get everyone thinking about the logical, sequential mindset of programming
	- [**Come back and explain how this will work**]
- **Demonstration**: Welcome to Stencyl
	- Now that we've covered the general ideas behind game development, we can talk specifics
	- Overview of Stencyl
		- What is the interface
		- What is an actor
		- What is a behavior
		- What is a tile
		- What is a scene
	- Along the way, creating a basic platformer on-the-fly
		- Creating a sprite in Pencyl
		- Creating a tileset in Pencyl 
		- Tying it together to create an actor that can walk+jump around a tile-based scene
- **Activity**: Making a basic platformer
	- **This may require students to pair up**
	- Now it's the student's turn to go through the steps of making their platformer
		- Decide what you want your game to be about
		- Plan out how to turn the screen into a level
		- Pull out grid paper
			- Draw actors
			- Draw background
			- Draw tiles
		- Plan out logic
		- Translate everything to Stencyl

### Session 2: Building a complete platformer ###

- **Discussion**: Overview and Schedule
	- Writing (on the whiteboard) what we will we cover today
- **Activity**: Critical play of **[insert game]**, a platformer with a meaning
- **Activity**: Critical play of **[insert game]**, a game with unique game "feel"
- **Demonstration**: Game feel
	- So far, we've only focused on narrative coming from art, but equally important is the narrative from the mechanics
	- Much like [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/), we will play with physics and logic to create different feeling games:
		- **ex 1**
		- **ex 2**
		- **ex 3**
- **Activity**: Game feel
	- Complement to the above demonstration
- **Activity**: Adding game feel to your platformer




### Session 3 ###
### Session 4 ###
### Session 5 ###

## Week 2: Creating a final project ##


### Session 6 ###
### Session 7 ###
### Session 8 ###
### Session 9 ###

- **Activity** Catch up day
	- Everyone needs to go back and finish any incomplete assignments
- **Activity** Burn CDs with their work

### Session 10 ###

- **Activity** Presentation day


<!---
Students make use of traditional and digital media to reflect contemporary hybrid processes, such as sketchbooking, storyboarding, writing, HTML5, JavaScript, Stencyl, sound effect editors, and Wacom digital drawing tablets.

COURSE OBJECTIVES/OUTCOMES |
Through the camp, students will:

1.	Critically engage with games as a form of creative expression 
2.	Understand the logic of computers and build real world programming skills
3.	Experience the iterative process of creating a game by
a.	Articulating ideas through sketching, storyboarding and prototyping
b.	Implementing ideas in the visual programming platform Stencyl and on the web through Javascript and HTML5
c.	Testing and tuning based on feedback and playtesting
