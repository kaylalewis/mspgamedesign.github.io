MSP Game Design Camp!

## Week 1 ##

**Intended Outcome: Learn about experimental games and learn the process of making a game through designing a series of games in Stencyl and HTML5**

### Session 1: What is a game?! ###

- Introductions (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Introduction to us
	- Nametag and Name Game Icebreaker
		- Get in a circle
		- Write names on tags
		- Have each person say 1) what you are hoping to learn and 2) the name of a game you like and what you like about it
		- Name game OR two truths and a lie
	- Overview and Schedule
		- Write on whiteboard a general outline for the camp
		- Write on whiteboard what we will we cover today
	- General classroom rules
		- Brainstorming the guidelines with the students
		- Write everything on the board
- What is a game? (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Definition
		- Everyone write down their definition on a card (save these, let's run this exercise again at the end)
		- Have a few individuals read their definitions and we'll write them on the board
		- Many people will mention "fun": ask them what does fun even mean?
		- Additional prompt: How does a game differ from comics, movies, books, etc.?
	- What types of games exist?
		- Two whiteboard brainstorming exercises: brainstorming types of games ("genres") and then brainstorming what games can be about ("content").
			- FPS, Puzzle, Platformer, etc.
			- Portal 2: escape. Braid: epiphanies. Canabalt: speed. Angry Birds: slingshots. Etc.
		- Goal: Games can be about anything and they don't have to be within a "genre"
	- Experimental games (also, playtime!)
		- Show off a large set of experimental games
		- Have students play 1-2 games on laptops
		- Discussion about their "content"
- How does a computer/game work? (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Logic statement exercise: "Play" as Mario
		- Supplies needed: Paper and markers 
		- Break into 4 groups of 6 students
		- In each group, each student will draw a different image on their paper
			- Role one: player; image: Nintendo controller
			- Role two: Mario; image: mario's symbol
			- Role three: "if" statement about left arrow key; image: directional pad left arrow 
			- Role four: "if" statement about right arrow key; image: directional pad right arrow
			- Role five: "then" statement about moving left; image: stick figure taking a step left
			- Role six: "then" statement about moving right; image: stick figure taking a step right
		- Flow: Player presses a button, the "if" statements check the controller, the "then" statements listen to the "if" statements, the "then" statements tell Mario what to do
		- This exercise can be extended:
			- There can be a goal
			- There could be a puzzle that two avatars need to solve
	- After the exercise, take a minute to reinforce the concepts that we learned
- Lunch (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Show a movie
	- Show some video game trailers
	- Play 7-Up
	- Or release them into the cafe
- What does it take to make a game? (estimated duration: 30m)
	- Whiteboard brainstorming to ask what they think needs to go into a game
	- Then organize it into general categories, pull down some examples of the various categories and put them into a slideshow
		- Story
		- Art
		- Programming
		- Feedback & Playtesting

Rest of the schedule to be planned out:


Design Documents

- **Activity**: Critical play of **[insert game]**, understanding the creative side of a game
	- Everyone play game
	- Independently fill out a worksheet/paper with directed analysis
	- Class discussion analyzing the game
		- What did we like
		- What didn't we like
		- What was the message or intent of the game
		- Etc **[fill these in]** 
- **Demonstration**: Welcome to Stencyl
	- Now that we've covered the general ideas behind game development, we can talk specifics
	- Overview of Stencyl
		- What is the interface
		- What is an actor
		- What is a behavior
		- What is a tile
		- What is a scene
	- Along the way, creating a basic platformer on-the-fly
		- Creating a sprite in Pencyl
		- Creating a tileset in Pencyl 
		- Tying it together to create an actor that can walk+jump around a tile-based scene
- **Activity**: Making a basic platformer
	- **This may require students to pair up**
	- Now it's the student's turn to go through the steps of making their platformer
		- Decide what you want your game to be about
		- Plan out how to turn the screen into a level
		- Pull out grid paper
			- Draw actors
			- Draw background
			- Draw tiles
		- Plan out logic
		- Translate everything to Stencyl

### Session 2: Building a complete platformer ###

- **Discussion**: Overview and Schedule
	- Writing (on the whiteboard) what we will we cover today
- **Activity**: Critical play of **[insert game]**, a platformer with a meaning
- **Activity**: Critical play of **[insert game]**, a game with unique game "feel"
- **Demonstration**: Game feel
	- So far, we've only focused on narrative coming from art, but equally important is the narrative from the mechanics
	- Much like [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/), we will play with physics and logic to create different feeling games:
		- **ex 1**
		- **ex 2**
		- **ex 3**
- **Activity**: Game feel
	- Complement to the above demonstration
- **Activity**: Adding game feel to your platformer

- **Activity** Presentation day


<!---
Students make use of traditional and digital media to reflect contemporary hybrid processes, such as sketchbooking, storyboarding, writing, HTML5, JavaScript, Stencyl, sound effect editors, and Wacom digital drawing tablets.

COURSE OBJECTIVES/OUTCOMES |
Through the camp, students will:

1.	Critically engage with games as a form of creative expression 
2.	Understand the logic of computers and build real world programming skills
3.	Experience the iterative process of creating a game by
a.	Articulating ideas through sketching, storyboarding and prototyping
b.	Implementing ideas in the visual programming platform Stencyl and on the web through Javascript and HTML5
c.	Testing and tuning based on feedback and playtesting
